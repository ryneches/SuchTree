# SuchTree Class API Reference

## Overview
The `SuchTree` class provides high-performance phylogenetic tree manipulation using Cython. It supports:
- Fast tree traversal and node queries
- Patristic distance calculations
- Topological analysis
- Multiple tree formats (Newick, URL, file path)
- Integration with NetworkX and igraph

Some best practices to keep in mind :

1. Use node IDs for performance-critical code
2. Prefer bulk methods (`distances_bulk`) for multiple calculations
3. Cache frequently-used properties (like RED values)
4. Use traversal generators for memory efficiency

The supporting `SuchLinkedTrees` class provides several useful bookkeeping features for working with
co-phylogeny datasets, most importantly the ability to perform reciprocal masking of one tree by 
clades in its linked tree. Subset masking is thread-safe, fast and non-destructive. However, please
note that SuchTree 1.3 is the last release that will include this interface for SuchLinkedTrees. The
next major release will include a modernized, multi-tree container with a new interface.

## Initialization
```python
class SuchTree(tree_input: Union[str, Path])
```
Construct from:
- Newick string
- File path
- URL (http/https/ftp)

Example:
```python
tree = SuchTree("(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4));")
tree = SuchTree("https://example.com/tree.newick")
```

## Example Usage

Here are some examples of operations you can do with SuchTree.

```python
# Initialize a tree and print some basic properties
tree = SuchTree("(A:0.1,B:0.2,(C:0.3,D:0.4)E:0.5)F;")
print(f"Tree depth: {tree.depth}")
print(f"Leaf names: {tree.leaf_names}")

# Find some node relationships
node_id = tree.leaves['A']
parent_id = tree.get_parent(node_id)
children = tree.get_children(parent_id)

# Distance analysis
dist = tree.distance('A', 'C')
dist_matrix = tree.pairwise_distances(['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])

# Calculate RED values
red_values = tree.relative_evolutionary_divergence()

# Export tree as a networkx graph (requires networkx)
nx_graph = tree.to_networkx_graph()
```

## Error Handling

- `NodeNotFoundError`  : Invalid leaf name
- `InvalidNodeError`   : Invalid node ID
- `TreeStructureError` : Invalid tree operations
- `ValueError`         : Invalid input format
- `TypeError`          : Incorrect argument type

## Core Methods

### Node Relationships
```python
get_parent(node: Union[int, str]) -> int
```
Get immediate parent node for a given node.

Args:
    node: Node identifier as either integer ID or leaf name string

Returns:
    Integer ID of parent node. Returns -1 if called on root node.

Raises:
    NodeNotFoundError: If leaf name doesn't exist in the tree
    InvalidNodeError: If node ID is out of valid range (0 <= id < tree.size)

Example:
```python
parent_id = tree.get_parent("A")
parent_id = tree.get_parent(5)
```

```python
get_children(node: Union[int, str]) -> Tuple[int, int]
```
Get direct children of a node. 

Args:
    node: Node identifier as either integer ID or leaf name string
    
Returns:
    Tuple of (left_child, right_child) node IDs. Returns (-1, -1) for leaf nodes.
    
Raises:
    NodeNotFoundError: If leaf name doesn't exist
    InvalidNodeError: If node ID is invalid

Note:
    For multifurcating trees, only the first two children are returned. Use 
    `traverse_children()` method for complete child iteration.

```python
get_ancestors(node: Union[int, str]) -> Generator[int, None, None]
```
Generate ancestor node IDs from node to root. Yields parent IDs in ascending order from immediate parent to root.

```python
get_descendants(node_id: int) -> Generator[int, None, None]
```
Generate all descendant node IDs in depth-first order. Includes the starting node in the output.

```python
get_leaves(node: Union[int, str]) -> np.ndarray
```
Get array of leaf node IDs descended from a given node. Uses efficient buffer reuse for performance.

```python
get_support(node: Union[int, str]) -> float
```
Retrieve node support value. Returns -1 if no support available. Works for both internal nodes and leaves.

### Tree Navigation
```python
is_leaf(node: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Check if node is a leaf. Uses optimized Cython implementation for fast checking.

```python
is_internal(node: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Check if node is internal. Simply returns negation of `is_leaf` but provides clearer intent.

```python
is_ancestor(ancestor: Union[int, str], descendant: Union[int, str]) -> int
```
Test ancestral relationship. Returns:

- `1` if ancestor of descendant 
- `-1` if descendant is ancestor 
- `0` if no direct relationship

```python
is_descendant(descendant: Union[int, str], ancestor: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Convenience method that returns True if descendant is indeed a descendant of ancestor.

```python
is_root(node: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Check if node is the tree root. Uses direct comparison with stored root node ID.

```python
is_sibling(node1: Union[int, str], node2: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Check if two nodes share the same parent. Automatically returns False if either node is root.

```python
has_children(node: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Determine if node has any children. Equivalent to `is_internal` but may be more intuitive for some users.

```python
has_parent(node: Union[int, str]) -> bool
```
Check if node has a parent (i.e., is not root). Returns negation of `is_root`.

```python
common_ancestor(a: Union[int, str], b: Union[int, str]) -> int
```
Find most recent common ancestor of two nodes. Uses optimized MRCA algorithm with visited node tracking.

```python
path_between_nodes(a: Union[int, str], b: Union[int, str]) -> List[int]
```
Get node IDs forming the path between two nodes through their common ancestor. Returns list from a -> MRCA -> b.

### Distance Analysis

SuchTree was originally built to compute patristic (leaf-to-leaf) distances as
efficiently as possible. You have two choices to make :

- Do you want to use leaf names or leaf IDs?
- Do you want to to calculate distances for single a pair of leafs, or a table of leaf pairs?

It is important to remember that even if you have two trees with exactly the same
leaf names, the leafs will have different node IDs if the topologies are different.
For those cases, it is better to use use the leaf name to ID mappings (`SuchTree.leaves`
and `SuchTree.leaf_nodes`) to associate your leaf nodes with other data.

```python
distance(a: Union[int, str], b: Union[int, str]) -> float
```
Calculate patristic distance between two nodes along the tree.

Args:
    a: First node identifier (ID or name)
    b: Second node identifier (ID or name)

Returns:
    Sum of branch lengths along the path between nodes via their most recent 
    common ancestor (MRCA)

Raises:
    NodeNotFoundError: If either node name doesn't exist
    InvalidNodeError: If either node ID is invalid

Complexity:
    O(h) where h is the height of the tree. Uses cached ancestor paths for
    optimal performance.

Example:
```python
dist = tree.distance("A", "B")
dist = tree.distance(2, 5)
```

```python
distances_bulk(pairs: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray
```
Efficiently compute distances for multiple node pairs. Accepts (n, 2) array of node IDs. Uses Cython nogil implementation.

```python
distances_by_name(pairs: List[Tuple[str, str]]) -> List[float]
```
Convenience wrapper for bulk distance calculation using leaf names instead of IDs.

```python
pairwise_distances(nodes: list = None) -> np.ndarray
```
Generate full distance matrix for specified nodes (all leaves by default). Returns symmetric numpy array.

```python
distance_to_root(node: Union[int, str]) -> float
```
Calculate total branch length from node to root. Optimized with cumulative distance caching.

```python
nearest_neighbors(node: Union[int, str], k=1) -> List[Tuple[Union[int, str], float]]
```
Find k nearest neighbors to a node. Can search among specific nodes or all leaves by default.

### Tree Traversal

SuchTree includes a collection of generators for traversing the tree in
different ways. They all work the same way, other than the different order
of traversal.

```python
traverse_inorder(include_distances: bool = True) -> Generator
```
In-order traversal (left, root, right). Yields node IDs or (ID, distance) tuples.

```python
traverse_preorder(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator
"""
Iterate through nodes in pre-order traversal (parent before children).

Args:
    from_node: Starting node (default: root). Can be ID or name.
    
Yields:
    Node IDs in traversal order
    
Raises:
    NodeNotFoundError: If from_node name doesn't exist
    InvalidNodeError: If from_node ID is invalid

Memory:
    O(h) space complexity due to stack implementation, where h is tree height

Example:
```python
for node_id in tree.traverse_preorder():
    print(f"Visiting node {node_id}")
```

```python
traverse_postorder(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator
```
Post-order traversal (left, right, root). Useful for dependency resolution.

```python
traverse_levelorder(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator
```
Breadth-first level order traversal. Yields nodes by depth level.

```python
traverse_leaves_only(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator
```
Efficient traversal that only yields leaf nodes. Skips internal nodes.

```python
traverse_internal_only(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator
```
Traversal that skips leaf nodes. Useful for operations only on internal nodes.

```python
traverse_with_depth(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator[Tuple[int, int], None, None]
```
Traversal yielding (node ID, depth) pairs. Depth starts at 0 for root.

```python
traverse_with_distances(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Generator[Tuple[int, float, float], None, None]
```
Traversal yielding (node ID, distance to parent, cumulative distance to root).

### Topological Analysis

```python
bipartition(node: Union[int, str], by_id=False) -> frozenset
bipartitions(by_id=False) -> Generator[frozenset, None, None]
quartet_topology(a: Union[int, str], b: Union[int, str], c: Union[int, str], d: Union[int, str]) -> frozenset
quartet_topologies_bulk(quartets: Union[list, np.ndarray]) -> np.ndarray
quartet_topologies_by_name(quartets: List[Tuple[str, str, str, str]]) -> List[frozenset]
```

### Graph Operations
```python
adjacency_matrix(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
laplacian_matrix(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
incidence_matrix(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
degree_sequence(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Export & Conversion
```python
to_networkx_graph(from_node: Union[int, str] = None) -> 'networkx.Graph'
to_newick(include_support=True, include_distances=True) -> str
relative_evolutionary_divergence() -> Dict[int, float]
```
