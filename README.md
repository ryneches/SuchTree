### High-performance sampling of very large trees

You have a phylogenetic tree. You want to do some statistics with it. No
problem! There are lots of packages in Python that let you manipulate
phylogenies, like [`dendropy`](http://www.dendropy.org/),
[`scikit-bio`](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/latest/tree.html) and
[`ete3`](http://etetoolkit.org/). If your tree isn't *too* big and your statistical
method doesn't require *too* many traversals, you you have a lot of great
options. If you're working with about a thousand taxa or less, you should
have no problem. You can forget about `SuchTree` and use a tree package that
has lots of cool features.

However, if you are working with trees that include tens of thousands, or
maybe even millions of organisms, you are going to run into problems. `ete3`,
`dendropy` and `scikit-bio`'s `TreeNode` are all designed to give you lots of
flexibility. You can re-root trees, use different traversal schemes, attach
metadata to nodes, attach and detach nodes, splice sub-trees into or out of
the main tree, plot trees for publication figures and do lots of other useful
things. That power and flexibility comes with a price -- speed.

For trees of moderate size, it is possible to solve the speed issue by
working with matrix representations of the tree. Unfortunately, most
representations scale quadratically with the number of taxa in the tree.
A distance matrix for a tree of 100,000 taxa will consume about 20GB 
of RAM. If your method performs sampling, then almost every operation
will be a cache miss. Even if you have the RAM, it will be painfully slow.

### Sampling linked trees

Suppose you have more than one group of organisms, and you want to study
the way their interactions have influenced their evolution. Now, you have
several trees that link together to form a generalized graph. Oh no, not
graph theory!

Calm yourself! `SuchLinkedTrees` has you covered. At the moment,
`SuchLinkedTrees` supports trees of two interacting groups, but work is
underway to generalize it to any number of groups. Like `SuchTree`,
`SuchLinkedTrees` is not intended to be a general-purpose graph theory
package. Instead, it leverages `SuchTree` to efficiently handle the 
problem-specific tasks of working with co-phylogeny systems. It will load
your datasets. It will build the graphs. It will let you subset the graphs
using their phylogenetic or ecological properties. It will generate
weighted adjacency and Laplacian matrixes of the whole graph or of subgraphs
you have selected. It will generate spectral decompositions of subgraphs if
spectral graph theory is your thing.

And, if that doesn't solve your problem, it will emit sugraphs as `Graph`
objects for use with the [`igraph`](http://igraph.org/) network analysis
package, or node and edge data for building graphs in 
[`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/). Now you can do even more things. 
Maybe you want to get all crazy with some 
[graph kernels](https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/GraphKernels)?
Well, now you can.

### Benchmarks

`SuchTree` is motivated by a simple the observation. A distance matrix of
100,000 taxa is quite bulky, but the tree it represents can be made to fit
into about 7.6MB of RAM if implemented using only `C` primitives. This is
small enough to fit into L2 cache on many modern microprocessors. This comes
at the cost of traversing the tree for every calculation (about 16 hops from
leaf to root for a 100,000 taxa tree), but, as these operations all happen
on-chip, the processor can take full advantage of 
[pipelining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_pipelining),
[speculative execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution) 
and other optimizations available in modern CPUs.

Here, we use `SuchTree` to compare the topology of two trees built
from the same 54,327 sequences using two methods : neighbor joining
and Morgan Price's [`FastTree`](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/)
approximate maximum likelihood algorithm. Using one million randomly
chosen pairs of leaf nodes, we look at the patristic distances in each
of the two trees, plot them against one another, and compute
correlation coefficients.

On an Intel i7-3770S, `SuchTree` completes the two million distance
calculations in a little more than ten seconds.

```python
from SuchTree import SuchTree
import random

T1 = SuchTree( 'data/bigtrees/ml.tree' )
T2 = SuchTree( 'data/bigtrees/nj.tree' )

print( 'nodes : %d, leafs : %d' % ( T1.length, len(T1.leafs) ) )
print( 'nodes : %d, leafs : %d' % ( T2.length, len(T2.leafs) ) )
```

```
nodes : 108653, leafs : 54327
nodes : 108653, leafs : 54327
```

```python
N = 1000000
v = list( T1.leafs.keys() )

pairs = []
for i in range(N) :
    pairs.append( ( random.choice( v ), random.choice( v ) ) )

%time D1 = T1.distances_by_name( pairs ); D2 = T2.distances_by_name( pairs )
```

```

```python
from scipy.stats import kendalltau, pearsonr

print( 'Kendall\'s tau : %0.3f' % kendalltau( D1, D2 )[0] )
print( 'Pearson\'s r   : %0.3f' % pearsonr( D1, D2 )[0] )
```
```
Kendall's tau : 0.709
Pearson's r   : 0.969
```

### Installation

`SuchTree` depends on the following packages :

* `scipy`
* `numpy`
* `dendropy`
* `cython`
* `pandas`

To install the current release, you can install from PyPI :

```
pip install SuchTree
```

If you install using `pip`, binary packages
([`wheels`](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/)) are available for CPython 3.6, 3.7,
3.8, 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11 on Linux x86_64 and on MacOS with Intel and Apple
silicon. If your platform isn't in that list, but it is supported by
[`cibuildwheel`](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel), please file an issue
to request your platform! I would be absolutely _delighted_ if someone was
actually running `SuchTree` on an exotic embedded system or a mainframe.

To install the most recent development version :

```
git clone https://github.com/ryneches/SuchTree.git
cd SuchTree
./setup.py install
```

### Basic usage

`SuchTree` will accept either a URL or a file path :

```python
from SuchTree import SuchTree

T = SuchTree( 'test.tree' )
T = SuchTree( 'https://github.com/ryneches/SuchTree/blob/master/data/gopher-louse/gopher.tree' )
```

The available properties are :

* `length` : the number of nodes in the tree
* `depth` : the maximum depth of the tree
* `root` : the id of the root node
* `leafs` : a dictionary mapping leaf names to their ids
* `leafnodes` : a dictionary mapping leaf node ids to leaf names

The available methods are :

* `get_parent` : for a given node id or leaf name, return the parent id
* `get_children` : for a given node id or leaf name, return the ids of
the child nodes (leaf nodes have no children, so their child node ids will
always be -1)
* `get_distance_to_root` : for a given node id or leaf name, return
the integrated phylogenetic distance to the root node
* `mrca` : for a given pair of node ids or leaf names, return the id
of the nearest node that is parent to both
* `distance` : for a given pair of node ids or leaf names, return the
patristic distance between the pair
* `distances` : for an (n,2) array of pairs of node ids, return an (n)
array of patristic distances between the pairs
* `distances_by_name` for an (n,2) list of pairs of leaf names, return
an (n) list of patristic distances between each pair
* `dump_array` : print out the entire tree (for debugging only! May
produce pathologically gigantic output.)

### Example datasets

For analysis of ecological interactions, `SuchTree` is distributed
with a curated collection of several different examples from the
literature. Additionally, a collection of simulated interactions with
various properties, along with an annotated notebook of `Python` code
for generating them, is also included. Interactions are registered in
a JSON object (`data/studies.json`).
